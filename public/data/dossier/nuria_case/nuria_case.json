  "bio": "In the early stages of the project, my primary contributions were in creating concept art and environment thumbnails to help define the visual direction. As development progressed, I transitioned to asset dressing for the first and second levels, ensuring each asset was properly optimized and exported for in-game use. Throughout the majority of the project, my focus remained on asset dressing, though I also supported other areas when needed. This included designing decals, developing the main logo and various UI elements, and offering support during the production of the game trailer.",
