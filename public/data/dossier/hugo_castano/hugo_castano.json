  "bio": "In this project, I started working on every part of the design process, as I was the only one in the design department with any knowledge about the Warhammer 40K universe.\n\nAfter the first weeks of the projects were finished, I did some moodboards for the different levels. After that I made the game's narrative, from dialogues to loading screens text.\n\nAfter all the design was done, I started doing QA, looking for bugs and reporting them.",
