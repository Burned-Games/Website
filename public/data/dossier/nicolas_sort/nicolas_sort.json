  "bio": "In this project, I was responsible for the full design of the main character. I defined their gameplay role, visual identity, and overall integration within the game world. I designed the majority of the character's audio effects, making sure they aligned with the gameplay and the game's aesthetic tone. I also created several particle effects myself to enhance the character's visual feedback. Additionally, I handled the balancing of the character's stats to support fair and engaging gameplay. I actively participated in QA sessions throughout development to identify issues, refine mechanics, and polish the final experience.",
