  "bio": "During the project, I worked as the UI artist, focusing on the user interface elements to ensure a visual cohesive and intuituve player experience. My work included the art of the in-game HUD, which communicates essential gameplay information, as well as the UI for the Abilities, Buffs and Debuffs icons. I also created various interface components such as guide buttons. I also made the art of the Pause screen, Controller Controls Screen and the Settings Screen, making sure each screen was both functional and visually aligned with the game's aesthetics. Throughout the project, I aimed to deliver a clean and immersive UI experience that supports gameplay and increases the visual identity of the videogame.",
