  "bio": "As Lead Programmer, I was responsible for defining and maintaining the game's technical structure from pre-production to final release. I coordinated the code department, organizing tasks, ensuring technical consistency, and facilitating communication across teams. I personally handled the planning and execution of both the engine and game release processes, ensuring stability, version control, and deployment accuracy. Throughout the project, I also contributed directly to several core systems, including the engine's particle module, destructible props, gameplay indicators, camera boundaries, and various optimization tasks. Additionally, I provided technical support across gameplay systems, including Player, Enemies, UI, and Environment, helping team members troubleshoot, integrate, and maintain quality code.",
