  "bio": "Working on this project has allowed me to contribute to different artistic aspects of videogame development. During the initial phase, I focused on creating several concepts based on the designer's guidelines. One of the highlights was my Main Character concepts for the Space Marine, where we began shaping the visual identity of the character. Afterwards, I moved on to 3D modeling: I started with the Chainsword, the Space Marine's weapon, and then transitioned to modeling environment props, meeting both the technical and artistic requirements we were aiming for. Finally, I joined the VFX team, where I contributed by creating VFX using both Particle Systems and Mesh-based Systems.",
