  "bio": "At the early stage of the project, I led the physics team to build and refine the missing physics systems in our engine. Later on, I developed a custom particle system for the engine. After establishing the core concept and structure, I also implemented a particle effect component, allowing designers to control visual effects more efficiently. As a gameplay programmer, I created powerful weapons for our main character, including a shotgun and a throwable grenade, adding depth and intensity to the combat experience. I then took on the role of UI programmer, where I independently developed the mission system, popup system, and dialogue system within the UI framework. I continuously improved these systems by implementing new features based on designer feedback, making them more polished and user-friendly. Lastly, I also contributed to the development of the project's web interface.",
