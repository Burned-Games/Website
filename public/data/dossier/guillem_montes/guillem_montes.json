  "bio": "As the producer, my main task was to organize the work of the entire class based on their specialties and the development timeline. I created a development plan and used organizational tools such as Drive, Notion, and Discord, which I kept constantly updated to ensure the project remained well-structured.

We worked with the Scrum methodology, which I managed and led with the help of the production team and the Scrum Masters. Every two weeks, we updated these groups according to the project's needs.",
