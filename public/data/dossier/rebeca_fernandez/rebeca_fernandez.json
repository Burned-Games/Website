  "bio": "As an artist on this project, I worked on enemy conceptualization and creation, environment art, and visual effects. I started with enemy concepts, especially the support enemy and its weapon. After several iterations and once the design was finalized, I executed the complete 3D modeling pipeline from blockout through final texturing, focusing on optimization. When that phase was finished, I joined the environment team. I had to quickly adapt to the established workflow and develop a variety of props to help bring the different maps to life as a team. At the same time, I participated in the initial phase of particle systems. This was a particular challenge, as it required research and experimentation to create appealing and functional visual effects within the engine's limitations.",
