  "bio": "In this project, I was part of the art department, with my main focus on animation and 3D modeling. I started by creating some concepts for the main character's design. I also created the full 3D models of the player's Bolter weapon, the Ork Boy, and the Ork Rifle (blockout, high-poly, low-poly, and textured), as well as the rig for the Ork Boy. I then moved on to creating controllers and fully animating the Space Marine, the Ork Boy, the Weird Boy, and Garrosh. I also animated the intro and endgame cinematics and helped develop the trailer.",
