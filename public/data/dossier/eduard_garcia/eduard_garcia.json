  "bio": "I contributed to the Input and UI modules by developing scripting functions and fixing various bugs. I implemented several particle effects in an initial iteration and then carried out multiple iterations to create collisions in Blender, polishing them to their final form. Finally, I took part in QA sessions, where I identified and documented bugs.",
