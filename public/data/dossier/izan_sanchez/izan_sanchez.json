  "bio": "In this project, I was primarily responsible for the complete design of all enemies and the Boss, covering everything from their visual appearance to their behavior and abilities. In addition to the design, I was also in charge of creating the sound effects for both the enemies and the Boss, as well as some of the visual particle effects associated with them. Finally, I handled the balancing of the enemies' and Boss's stats, and actively participated in QA sessions to polish the game experience as much as possible.",
