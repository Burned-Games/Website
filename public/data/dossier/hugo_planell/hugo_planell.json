  "bio": "I am the original creator of TeaEngine, a custom game engine that served as the foundation for the development of Coffee Engine, which I co-created together with Mario Dorado Mart√≠nez. This engine was used in the development of Warhammer 40k: The Last Marine. Throughout the project, I worked with a team that I led as Lead Engine, coordinating development and making key technical decisions regarding the engine's direction. During the project, I focused on core areas such as rendering, resource management, Coffee Runtime, the scripting system and its maintenance, frustum culling, the Scene Manager, and serialization. I was also responsible for the technical documentation and ensuring the engine's cross-platform support. In addition to my technical responsibilities, I worked closely with my team to resolve bugs, providing constant technical support and effective solutions to complex issues.",
