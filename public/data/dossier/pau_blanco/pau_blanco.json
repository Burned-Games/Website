  "bio": "In this project, I was mainly responsible for the artistic design of enemies, creation of props for the levels, and animations. I designed several iterations for enemies such as the Tank, Boss, and Miniboss. Later on, I also created props and tileable textures. Finally, in the latest iterations, I have done all the animations for the Tank and the introduction cutscene for Level 3. In conclusion, I would say that what I enjoyed the most in this project was the enemy concept art and the animations.",
