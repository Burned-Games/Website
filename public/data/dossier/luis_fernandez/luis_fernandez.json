  "bio": "In this project, I worked mainly on the environment art part, producing assets from concept arts and keeping a cohesion with the other assets made by the other artists. The assets have followed a blockout process, then highpoly design to finish with texturing. After finishing the assets section I got involved with the VFX, in which I completed the “Thunder Fury” attack of the final boss.",
