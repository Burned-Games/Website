  "bio": "As Lead Designer, I was responsible for shaping the creative and structural foundation of the project, bridging vision with execution. I led the design department while coordinating across all teams, ensuring that every element of the game was aligned with our core experience. I designed and balanced core systems such as combat statistics, in-game economy, and camera behavior. I created the Game Design Document from scratch and iterated on it throughout development to reflect both evolving ideas and production realities. I designed and built levels with a strong focus on flow and pacing. I developed a fully guided tutorial experience to support onboarding.",
