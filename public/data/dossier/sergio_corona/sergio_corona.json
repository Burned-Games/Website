  "bio": "In this project, I worked as an Environment Artist, creating assets based on concept sketches provided by a concept artist. During the process, I learned and applied the full modeling pipeline to produce optimized assets suitable for videogame. Each asset followed a clear workflow: starting with a blockout, followed by a high-poly sculpt in ZBrush, and then baking the details onto a low-poly version for texturing. After completing the props, I moved on to VFX, where I created a support attack â€” an electric projectile.",
